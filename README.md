# AnagramAnagram Finder
Description

This Java program reads words from a text file and groups them into sets of anagrams â€” words composed of the same letters in a different order.
Requirements
Java 8 or higher
IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE
Input file named sample.txt placed in the root of the project

How to Run
Copy or download the project.
Place the sample.txt file in the root directory (next to Main.java).
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-compatible IDE.
Compile and run the program using:

javac Main.java
java Main

The output will be printed to the console.

Implementation Methodology
All words are read from the input file using BufferedReader.
Each word is converted into a character array, sorted alphabetically using Arrays.sort(), and converted back into a string to form a key.
Words are grouped using a HashMap<String, List<String>>, where the key is the sorted character string.
Groups of words sharing the same key are collected and printed as anagram groups.
This approach ensures that all words with identical character compositions, regardless of order, are placed in the same group.
Input Format

Each line of sample.txt contains one word, for example:

act
cat
tree
race
care
acre
bee

Expected Output

[act, cat]
[tree]
[acre, care, race]
[bee]

Scalability Considerations
For 10 million words:
The program uses buffered reading, which avoids loading the entire file into memory.
HashMap provides constant-time insertion and lookup, supporting efficient grouping.
Initial capacities for collections can be increased to reduce resizing overhead.

For 100 billion words:
Processing must be done in a stream-oriented or distributed manner.
Intermediate results should be written to disk or stored in a database.
Technologies such as MapReduce (Hadoop or Apache Spark) should be used to parallelize processing by anagram key.
Memory usage must be minimized, and data must be processed in chunks or batches.
